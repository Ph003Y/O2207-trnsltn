SOMETHING ABOUT CHRIS:

Since childhood, Chris has 
been a very strong and 
nimble boy - but he has 
always had trouble finding 
common ground with 
others. If Chris suddenly 
wants to eat a tasty 
candy, he is more likely 
to take it by force, not 
by persuasion or trickery.

A little rough, ruthless, 
not afraid of anything 
and thirsty for 
adventure... 
Is he really the new age 
hero we need?
