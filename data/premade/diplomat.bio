SOMETHING ABOUT CLIFF:

Clifford has always been
a rather weak and sickly
boy, but he always has a
striking talent to please
everyone around him.
Cliff soon realized that
many problems are better
solved at the right time
and with the right words.

With his attentiveness 
and sensitivity, not to 
mention his winning 
charms, Cliff undoubtedly 
awaits a high and rising 
diplomat career!
