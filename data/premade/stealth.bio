SOMETHING ABOUT KEVIN:

Let's face it, Kevin
never really shone with
his mind. Quite contrary
he amazed every one with
its complete absence, 
but he more than makes
up for it with a near
inhuman luck and his
feet worthy of a Kenyan
olympic marathon runner!

Undoubtedly, the lack of
intelligence will affect
the future of the boy,
but constant luck and his
fast legs will help him
get out of any situation!
